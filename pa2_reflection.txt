1. (1pt) Approximately how long did you spend on this PA?
I had do more in the of this PA due to not understanding my main\
function less time. Thus was confused on how to do testing which a good knowledge\
of the scope of usage for my program. Therefore i spent 21 hours on this assignment but\
I'm glad if I'm being honest I feel as though I'm finally gaining understanding of Java \
versus the first time I took the intro course for the language 4 years ago now.
2. (3pt) What is something that you think you did well on this PA?
The testing I found it in the immediate future to be more beneifical especially with the \
habits I have developed with the intent of having bugs. Then fixing after the fact thus I spent\
more time on the question then the others although a hoping I haven't made too many
concessions in the othter problems during the process.
3. (3pt) What is something that you struggled with on this PA?
I'm still confused on the references of the Lists and even more so now\
with the circircularly linked structure. Being defined by modulus in the psoition of the nodes\
although that may just be my weaker math background getting confused on the implication of\
using modulus to define your head and tails with n length arrays.
4. (1pt) Would you rather have done PA 0 and PA 1 together in one assignment, or did it help you to have them as separate assignments? 
This is the same question from last week so I'm not entirely sure to what degree\
my input on the matter will have an effect. But I personally still found it helpful provided\
more time for ensuring your environment works which can be considered by some to \
be the hardest part of coding.
